##Working Experience  

Apr 2012 - Present, GPU Infrastructure Architect, **nVidia**  

*   Maintaining Direct3D tools which decrease the size and running time of API traces and keep the performances match, it requires understanding of the application behavior.
*   Using graphics debugging tools( Microsoft PIX/ Intel GPA/ Nsight/ internal tools) to analyze bottlenecks and improve performance.
*   Building an automatic work flow to cover Direct3D9/10/11 traces.
*   Maintaining OpenGL API capture, converting and replay tools.

Jul 2011 - Mar 2012, Senior Software Engineer, **ShanDa Interactive Entertainment Ltd**  

*   Augmented Reality SDK development, responsible for the scene graph and animation system.
*   Research on Image Retrieval, extending OpenCV with flann to support approximate kMeans clustering.
*   iOS game development, responsible for rendering of collidable particle system (cocos2d-x/ box2d) and state-machine based AI system.

Mar 2011 - Jul 2011, Game Engine Programmer, **Ubisoft Shanghai**  

*   Working on NCIS video game (WII/ PS3/ 360/ PC), responsible for localization system, a uniform save/ load mechanism on all platforms and game editor improvement.
*   TRC/ TCR/ LotCheck implementation to pass Microsoft/ Sony/ Nintendo's verifications.

May 2010 - Feb 2011, Junior Programmer, **2K Games China**  

*   Localization of an Xbox 360 game, responsible for UI layout adjustment and game logic debugging.
